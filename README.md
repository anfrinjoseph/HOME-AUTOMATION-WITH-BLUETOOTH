This project demonstrates a Bluetooth-controlled home automation system using an Arduino Uno, allowing users to remotely control electrical devices via a Bluetooth connection from a smartphone. The system utilizes an HC-05 Bluetooth module for wireless communication and relay modules to switch devices on and off. In the Proteus simulation, I created a schematic that includes the Arduino Uno, HC-05 Bluetooth module, and relay modules. However, please note that I have not connected any actual devices (like bulbs or appliances) to the relay module in the simulation, and the GND and VCC pins of the Bluetooth module are not connected, which is essential for proper operation in a real-world application.

The Arduino code was developed using the Arduino IDE, establishing a Bluetooth connection and listening for commands sent from a smartphone. Based on the received commands, the code controls the relay modules to turn devices on or off, using simple character inputs: '1' to turn on a device, '0' to turn it off, '2' for another device, and '3' to turn it off again. This project serves as a foundational step towards building a more comprehensive home automation system, with future enhancements possible, such as adding more devices, integrating sensors, or implementing a user-friendly mobile application for better control.
